# WebPublishingFinal
This was my final assignment for my Web Publishing class ~ The idea was to use a given figma and create a working site with it as the appearance.

Decision on Differences 

~ Overall Slight punctuation/capitalization changes 

~ Home Page 
Added a hover color article preview 'Read more...' links 
There is a popular tag mismatch when comparing the word docs and the figma, I went with the ones in the word documents 
Changed date of 2nd article Changed date of 3rd article 

~ Article pages 
Changes a few sizes around to make it easier to read & bring more attention to things like the author and the headings 
Recolored top follow button to be white in color 
Realigned the PFP/Name+Date to fit be consistent with text margin 
Realigned the Tags at the bottom to fit be consistent with text margin 
Recolored bottom follow button to be 'text color' in color 
Added a hover color to the 'Post Comment' button 

~ Settings/NewArticle 
Kept the nav bar consistent with the home page
Added heading on new article page 

~Learned while doing the final 
Don't use <bv /> to create space between elements, use margins like they are meant to be used 
Use DIV elements like I should be! 
If I need to specify something more specifically, dont code it into the HTML page, create a div for the extra branch of specificity! 
Style more specifically using more div elements to stop unwanted changes
